Hello there! I'm Samuel Nwoye, an infrastructure engineer with security skills. I have consulted for several clients where I built and managed enterprise infrastructure: describing services and implementing secure development and delivery pipelines.  

I helped facilitate a startup's timely delivery to market, orchestrated the entire infrastructure for a content platform and financial application from the ground up, introduced and implemented infrastructure as code for an identity management company, revamped the security posture of a healthcare company and saved substantial amounts in operational costs for enterprises after reviewing her architecture and workload. 

I am a Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist with good knowledge of the cloud-native landscape employing the right tools in deploying reliable, secure and well-instrumented systems. I have a knack for finding flaws in systems and remediating them. My implementations strive to satisfy HIPPA, PCI-DSS and ISO27001 compliances. 

My core speciality centres on designing, deploying and maintaining secure and reliable infrastructure with a strong focus on improving developers' productivity by reducing mean time to delivery on every code change, instrumenting the system to report insightful feedback to developers and executives and ultimately minimizing the company's operational expenses.
